## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Comparing Docker containers with virtual machines

Containers, or Linux Containers, are a technology that allows us to isolate certain kernel processes and trick them into thinking they're the only ones running in a completely new computer.

Different from Virtual Machines, a container can share the kernel of the operating system while only having their different binaries/libraries loaded with them.

In other words, you don't need to have whole different OS (called guest OS) installed inside your host OS. You can have several containers running within a single OS without having several different guest OS's installed.

## Install Laravel Echo

[Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/broadcasting#client-pusher-channels) is a JavaScript library that makes it painless to subscribe to channels and listen for events broadcast by your server-side broadcasting driver. You may install Echo via the NPM package manager. In this example, we will also install the pusher-js package.
